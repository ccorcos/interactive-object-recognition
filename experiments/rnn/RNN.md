# RNN - Recurrent Neural Network

Explain the datasets, experiments, and results

## Background

Some maths and SVG drawings, etc.

## Results

An RNN can't even learn a single dice, let alone a whole set of dice. The problem
seems to be that the model cannot generate the latent pose which is crucual to
condition against.


# RNN/V1

Basic implementation.

Not sure whether to use binary cross-entropy error or sum square error

# RNN/V2

Momentum implemented

# RNN/V3

Train on the real nextProbs -- doesnt work!

# RNN/V4

refactor with classes. doenst really work though :/

# RNN/V5

refactor works

# RNN/V6

deep transitions to input, output, and transitions

# RNN/V7
