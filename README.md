# IOR - Interactive Object Recognition


## To Do

- make the rnn.py more portable
- move my model into this project as well
- run the rnn on all the data and report the results
- run the run on just one die and report the results
- run on all the dice with dropout and report the results
- everything again on my own model
- everything again with a HMM

- make a "BACKGROUND.md" to talk about the theory and the previous work.

## Getting Started

    pip install sparkprob
    pip install se3
    python dice/setup.py develop
