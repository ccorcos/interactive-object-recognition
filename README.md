# IOR - Interactive Object Recognition

This repo contains my research in interactive object recognition.

Right now, I'm working on building an unsupervised model to predict the next side
of a die after an action given all previous actions and observations.

## Getting Started

    pip install sparkprob
    pip install se3
    cd dice
    python setup.py develop

This package also depends on my [Deep Learning repo](https://github.com/ccorcos/deep-learning).
After cloning it, make sure you setup and develop that package as well. 

You can clean up with

    python setup.py develop --uninstall
